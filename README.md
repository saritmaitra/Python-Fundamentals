# Python-Fundamentals
## Pandas
    pip install pandas 
    import pandas as pd
###FEATURES:
- Pandas were initially developed by Wes McKinney in 2008; Chang She, joined as the second major contributor to the library in 2012
- Fast and efficient for manipulating and analysing data.
- Data from different file objects can be loaded.
- Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) 
- Data manipulation (column insert/delete, dataset merging and joining, reshaping and pivoting of data sets etc. can be performed)
## Numpy
### INSTALLATION:    
    pip install numpy
    import numpy as np
 
### FEATURES:
- NumPy stands for Numerical Python 
- NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. 
- It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra.
- NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. 
- NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. 
- It is an open source project and we can use it freely. 

### DIFF PANDAS & NUMPY:
- When we have to work on Tabular data, we prefer the pandas module and when we have to work on Numerical data, we prefer the numpy module. 
- The powerful tools of pandas are Data frame and Series whereas the powerful tool of numpy is Arrays. 
- Pandas consume more memory. Numpy is memory efficient. 
- Pandas has a better performance when number of rows is 500K or more.Numpy has a better performance when number of rows is 50K or less. 
- Indexing of the pandas series is very slow as compared to numpy arrays. Indexing of numpy Arrays is very fast. 
- Pandas offers two dimensional table object called DataFrame. Numpy is capable of providing multi-dimensional arrays.
