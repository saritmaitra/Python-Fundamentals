# Python-Fundamentals
## Numpy
### INSTALLATION:    
    pip install numpy
    import numpy as np
    
### FEATURES:
- NumPy stands for Numerical Python 
- NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. 
- It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra.
- NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. 
- NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. 
- It is an open source project and we can use it freely. 

### DIFF PANDAS & NUMPY:
When we have to work on Tabular data, we prefer the pandas module and when we have to work on Numerical data, we prefer the numpy module. The powerful tools of pandas are Data frame and Series whereas the powerful tool of numpy is Arrays. Pandas consume more memory.Numpy is memory efficient. Pandas has a better performance when number of rows is 500K or more.Numpy has a better performance when number of rows is 50K or less. Indexing of the pandas series is very slow as compared to numpy arrays. Indexing of numpy Arrays is very fast. Pandas offers 2d table object called DataFrame. Numpy is capable of providing multi-dimensional arrays.

For your question usually numpy is faster as it consumes less memory and otherwise choice between two largely depends on size of dataset.
