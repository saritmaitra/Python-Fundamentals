The \"exclusive or' is True if one operands is True and the other operands is False: there is no exclusive or operator, but != on booleans has the same semantics.\n",

Note that conversion the other way might not be equivalent: e.g., there is no way to convert 1.5 to an equivalent integer.\n",

Promote means movement up the numeric type hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arithmetic on Mixed Types:\n",
    "To perform any arithmetic operator on two operands that do not have the same type, the lower type operand is promoted to the type of the higher type operand: so, in True * 1.5 the boolean value True is promoted to the integer value 1, which is promoted to the floating–point value 1.0, which is then satisfying one of the prototypes for * multiplied by 1.5, which returns the result 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversions in these two cases are implicit: they are performed automatically by Python, to be able to satisfy the prototypes of the operators. But we can also explicitly convert between numeric types, both up and down the numeric type hierarchy. In fact, we can use bool, str, and each numeric type name (int, float, and complex) as the name of a function that converts values to that type from other types.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Rules and Naming Convention for Variables and constants\n",
    "Constant and variable names should have a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_). For example:\n",
    "- snake_case: snake case uses an underscore between words to create separation\n",
    "- MACRO_CASE\n",
    "- camelCase: When multiple words are used to form a variable, camel case joins those words together, without any white space, and delineates the start of each new word with a capital letter. \n",
    "- CapWords\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential benefits\n",
    "Some of the potential benefits that can be obtained by adopting a naming convention include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- to provide additional information (i.e., metadata) about the use to which an identifier is put;\n",
    "- to help formalize expectations and promote consistency within a development team;\n",
    "- to enhance clarity in cases of potential ambiguity;\n",
    "- to enhance the aesthetic and professional appearance of work product (for example, by disallowing overly long names, comical or \"cute\" names, or abbreviations);\n",
    "- to help avoid \"naming collisions\" that might occur when the work product of different organizations is combined (see also: namespaces);\n",
    "- to provide meaningful data to be used in project handovers which require submission of program source code and all relevant documentation;\n",
    "- to provide better understanding in case of code reuse after a long interval of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Create a name that makes sense. For example, vowel makes more sense than v.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to create a variable name having two words, use underscore to separate them. For example:\n",
    "- my_name\n",
    "- current_salary\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Use capital letters possible to declare a constant. For example:\n",
    "- PI\n",
    "- G\n",
    "- MASS\n",
    "- SPEED_OF_LIGHT\n",
    "- TEMP\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Never use special symbols like !, @, #, $, %, etc.\n",
